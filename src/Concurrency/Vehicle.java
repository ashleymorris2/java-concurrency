 * 1. Concurrency.Vehicle objects are created by Concurrency. EntryPoint objects to simulate the vehicles arriving on the local road
 * network from the motorway junctions etc.
 *
 * 2. The class needs to have attributes which store its destination (one of several, determined when it is
 * created according to configurable ratios), the time it entered Gridlock, and the time it finally
 * parked.
 *
 * 3. As well as constructor and (destructor??) methods, Vehicle must have a method to allow a Junction
 * to read the vehicleâ€™s destination.
